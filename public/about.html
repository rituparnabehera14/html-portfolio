<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Rituparna Behera is my name. At the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology in Bhubaneswar,
   Odisha, I am a 21-year-old student pursuing a Btech in Computer Science. Although I reside in 
   Bhubaneswar with my family, my hometown is Sand City, Balasore. I'm currently enjoying my dull holiday as
   a third-year BTech student!</p>
